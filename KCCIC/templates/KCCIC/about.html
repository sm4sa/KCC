        <h2>About our College Community:</h2>
        <p>We are a Christian college fellowship group serving at Korean Community Church in Charlottesville (KCCIC). 
          Our logo is named H.I.M, which is an acronym for “Here I Am” from the Bible passage Isaiah 6:8: “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I. Send me!” <br>
          <br>
          We meet every Friday at 7PM and Sunday at 11AM to have praise, worship and fellowship. 
          Other religious activities include Bible study, discipleship training and Friday small groups. 
          Some of our group events include Big-Little buddies, Boy/Girl Lock-in, Fall retreat, (Spring) joint retreat, Praise/Alumni night, and Senior banquet. <br>
          <br>
          This year, our theme is Ephesians 4. <br>
          If you have any questions, please feel free to
