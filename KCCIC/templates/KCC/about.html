        <p>In order to register for classes at UVA, a student must have their advisor sign off on their schedule.
          This app allows students to view courses for the upcoming semester, create a schedule, and then send it to an advisor for approval.
            <ul>
              <li>Students must be able to search classes by course mnemonic, course number, and course name.</li>
              <li>Students must be able to add courses to a schedule, which will be saved with the student’s account.</li>
              <li>A schedule cannot have courses that have a time conflict.</li>
              <li>Students must be able to “submit” the schedule to an advisor to approve the schedule.</li>
              <li>An advisor should see all schedules available for review upon login.</li>
              <li>Any advisor should be able to approve or reject any schedule.</li>
              <li>When a schedule is approved or rejected, the student should be able to see this when they login.</li>
